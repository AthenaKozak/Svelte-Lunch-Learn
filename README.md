## Emoji Button Counter App with Svelte

Welcome to the Emoji Button Counter app built with Svelte! This simple web application allows you to interact with emojis and count the number of times each emoji has been clicked. It's a great example to showcase Svelte's reactivity and UI-building capabilities.

### How It Works

The app features a set of emojis, each of which can be clicked to increment its count. The total count of all clicked emojis is displayed. If the total count reaches 7 or more, the buttons are disabled to prevent further clicking. There's also a "Reset" button available if you want to reset the counts.
